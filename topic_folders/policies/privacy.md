This information may be collected via several technologies, including cookies and other means.

You can control cookies in your browser to enable or disable them. Learn more in our [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy.md).

**Information We Collect From Third Parties.** If you access our Sites through third parties (e.g., GitHub or Google), or if you share content from our Sites to a third party social media service, the third party service will send us certain information about you if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing. The information we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the third party service.

## 2. How Do We Use Personal Information?

**We Never Sell Personal Information.** We will never sell, rent or otherwise provide your Personal Information to any third party for marketing purposes.

  and coordination of coding and data science workshops, discussions, and other

  Team member position

## 3. How Do We Share Personal Information?

**To the Public with Your Consent.** We may share your name, education, social
media account handles, and professional affiliation with the public with your
consent for your role in our community and other Core Team members’ biographies,
or for lesson testimonials and reviews. The information you choose to provide to
us will determine how much information is shared with the public. You can opt-in
or opt-out of sharing your information publicly in your AMY profile.

**Affiliates and Service Providers.** We share your information with our
third-party service providers and any subcontractors as required to offer you
our products and services. For example, we use MailChimp to send our email
marketing campaigns, HelpScout for communications, Square to process payments,
and WeDidIt to collect program donations.

**Third Party Links and Websites.** Our Sites may contain links to and from the websites of third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any data to these websites.

**Disclosures Required by Law.** We may be required to disclose your data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet law enforcement requirements. We may be under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and other agreements, to protect our rights, property, or safety, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection.

**Aggregate and De-Identified Information.** We reserve the right to share aggregate or de-identified information about you with our volunteers, workshop partners, and funding partners in order to analyze and improve our programs, and apply for funding.

## 4. How Do We Respond to ‘Do Not Track’ Signals?

Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web
browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do
not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and
across websites or online services. When and where possible, we respect DNT
(e.g., page views on our Sites will not be recorded). However, we cannot
guarantee your DNT preference will be recognized across our Sites, as the
Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT
means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to
DNT.

## 5. Cookies

To make our Sites and services work properly, we sometimes place small data
files called cookies on your device. A cookie is a small text file that a
website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It
enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, or
other preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering
them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. To
learn more, please see our [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy.md).

**Matomo.** We use Matomo. We use the information we get from Matomo only to improve our Sites. We configured Matomo so no personal information is collected.

## 6. Your Privacy Choices

Please contact us if you would like to request access and/or make any changes to your personal information.

**Marketing Opt-Out:** We may use your personal information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in any email we send, or you can contact us using the contact details provided in the “Contact Information” section below.

We maintain appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law for any personal information transferred internationally, and as required by applicable law, will seek your consent prior to such transfers.

## 10.  Children’s Privacy

The Sites are not directed at individuals under the age of 16. We do not

## 12.  How Do We Protect Personal Information?
    
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal
information. For example, when possible, we use encryption to transfer and store
data. We further limit access to this data using access controls and
confidentiality commitments.

However, no website, application, or transmission can guarantee security. Thus,
while we have established and maintain what we believe to be reasonable
procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal
information obtained through the Sites, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
of any information you transmit to us.
