To make our sites work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login or other preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
 
We have put our cookies into the following categories to make it easier for you to understand why we need them:
 
1. **Strictly necessary:** These are used to help make our website work
   efficiently, provide security features on our website, and provide services
   you have asked for, like shopping carts and billing.
2. **Performance/analytics:** These are used to analyze the way our website
   works and how we can improve it.
3. **Functionality:** These help to enhance your experience by remembering
   choices you have made concerning the features of the website (e.g., username,
   language, region you are in).
 
## Cookies and You
 
If you choose not to enable cookies, you will still be able to browse our
website, but it will restrict some of the functionality of our website or what
you can do.
