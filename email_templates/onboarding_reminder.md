Subject: Reminder - Onboarding starts next week

Hi all,

Just a quick reminder that we'll be starting our onboarding meetings next week.
Please sign up for one of the two available sessions on our groups
[Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainer-onboarding).

During our meetings, we'll be test-running a
[new curriculum for Maintainer Onboarding](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/index.html).
Your suggestions and pull requests to this repository are more than welcome!
This curriculum will form the basis for onboarding of new groups of Maintainers
in the future, so please help to improve it.

Before our first meeting, please look at the first lesson in the Maintainer
Onboarding curriculum
([Social Aspects of Lesson Maintenance](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/01-social/index.html))
and do your best to work through the exercises marked "Preparatory Homework".

Looking forward to seeing you all soon. Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
{name}
