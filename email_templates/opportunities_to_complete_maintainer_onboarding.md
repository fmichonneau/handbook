Subject: Opportunities to complete Carpentry Maintainer onboarding

Hi all,

Thank you again for volunteering to act as a Carpentry Maintainer. You're
getting this email because you expressed interested in being a Maintainer but
were not able to attend the onboarding sessions. If you are still interested in
becoming a Maintainer, please choose one of the two following paths:

1) Reading through the three Maintainer Onboarding episodes, writing up your
responses to the discussion questions and homeworks, and sending me your
responses by {deadline}.

or

2) Joining the next Maintainer Onboarding session, which will be held in
{month}.

Please let me know as soon as possible which of these two paths you'd like to
follow, or if you are no longer interested in joining the Maintainer team. main
Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
{name}
