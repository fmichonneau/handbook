Subject: Maintainer Onboarding Meetings

Hi everyone,

Thank you for adding your availability to the scheduling poll. Based on
everyone's responses, we will be meeting at two different times. You do not need
to attend the same meeting each week, and I would actually encourage those who
can do so to switch which meeting they attend so that we can all meet one
another over the course of the onboarding.

We will be meeting for three weeks, starting the week of {date}. You can see the
meeting times in your local time zone on
[our Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainer-onboarding). 
If you know that you will need to miss one of our meetings, please let me know
as soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements for you to
complete the training.

Before our first meeting, please:

1) Sign up for the [Maintainer mailing list](http://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers).
This is a low-volume channel for communicating about issues relevant to the
Maintainer community.

2) Add Maintainer meetings to your schedule. The meeting times are listed on the
[Maintainer Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainers) and on the
[Community Calendar](https://software-carpentry.org/join/#calendar). The
Maintainer monthly meetings are not mandatory, but are encouraged as a way of
getting to know the more experienced Maintainers.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Looking forward to meeting all of you next month!

Best,
{name}
